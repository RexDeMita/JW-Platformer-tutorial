    /*
    PlatformEffector2D: a component of a 2D sprite that handles one way colliders among other things. you can set the angle of effect from 0 to 180
    
    Physics material 2D: friction and bounciness parameters you can apply to a collider
    
    Mathf: math library that deals with floating point numbers
    
    abs: absolute value 
    
    CapsuleCollider2D: cylindrical collider with no corners that can avoid getting stuck on things
    
    F2: rename the selected file
    
    Hierarchy: object and assets manager of objects in the scene view
    
    checkbox on the left side of the object name: setting an object as active or inactive
    
    prefab: pre fabricated object. an object that acts as a template to make duplication easier. drag an object from the hierarchy to the project folder labeled pre fabs. the icon of the object in the hierarchy should change to blue.
        to use prefabs, drag them from the project view into the scene view
        
        if you edit the prefab in the project view, you will edit all instances of that prefab in the scene view
